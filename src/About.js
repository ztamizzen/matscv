            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I've been a professional developer since 2000, before that it was just a hobby.</p>
            <p>In 1998 I decided to turn a hobby into a job, I haven't really had a hobby since.</p>
            <p>
                I started my career at Stockholm University and stayed there for 8 years.
                It was a good environment for a beginner, you where allowed to make
                mistakes and take your time learning new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the university I got a job at Eniro. At this time I started suffering from
                depression, it turns out I had a chronic depression and I didn't deal with it to well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up getting fired from Eniro because I was exhausted and couldn't get to work on time.
                What I should have done is taken a leave of absense and gotten my head straight.
                That was a lesson for me and something I'm quite ashamed of. I've only now decided to take
                responsebility for it and not let it be a source of stress and shame.
            </p>
            <h2>Consultant</h2>
            <p>
                After leaving Eniro I started looking for work, and looking for consultancy assignments.
                An contract was the first thing that popped up. From then on I've been a consulant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first years was rocky and I had a hard time getting work, I haden't really learnt the lesson
                from Eniro and put myself in even more stresful situations. During these years I've grown a lot,
                as a human, and learned many lessons about what is expexted of a consultant. I've, basically, grown up.
            </p>
            <h2>The future</h2>
            <p>I now try to run a professional business and have a lot to offer.</p>
